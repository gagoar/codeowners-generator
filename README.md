<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners) are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own. This is a great feature, but when working on monorepos ownership is shared between teams and it becomes difficult to maintain.

`codeowners-generator` allows you to position CODEOWNERS files anywhere in your project tree and it will take care of compiling all the files into a single generated file, that Github can understand. It also can read the maintainers fields (`contributors`, `author` and alternatively `maintainers`) in `package.json` (`useMaintainers` option in the cli ) making easy to keep CODEOWNERS and package.json in sync.

### Built With

- [ora](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora)
- [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/)
- [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Installation

If you wish to use `codeowners-generator` as a standalone utility:

```sh
npm -g install codeowners-generator
```

This will make the `codeowners-generator` command available in your terminal.

```sh
codeowners-generator --help
```

If instead you would like to add it to a package:

```sh
npm install --only=dev codeowners-generator
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Every command accepts several options through command line or custom configuration [see configuration for more](#configuration)

### Generate CODEOWNERS file

```sh
  codeowners-generator generate
```

### Generate CODEOWNERS file (using `maintainers` field from `package.json`)

```sh
codeowners-generator generate --useMaintainers
```

### Specify CODEOWNERS (in case the CODEOWNERS files are named differently)

```sh
  codeowners-generator generate --includes '**/CODEOWNERS'
```

<!-- CONFIGURATION -->

## Configuration

You can configure `codeowners-generator` from several places:

### CLI options

- **includes** (`--includes`): The glob used to find CODEOWNERS files in the repo `default: ['**/CODEOWNERS', '!CODEOWNERS', '!node_modules']`

- **useMaintainers** (`--useMaintainers`): It will use `maintainers` field from package.json to generate codeowners, by default it will use `**/package.json`

for more details you can invoke:

```sh
  codeowners-generator --help
```

### Custom Configuration

You can also define custom configuration in your package:

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "codeowners-generator": {
    "includes": ["**/CODEOWNERS"],
    "useMaintainers": true
  },
  "scripts": {
    "codeowners": " codeowners-generator generate"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "codeowners-generator": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

When the command is invoked it will look for the `codeowners-generator` configuration block.

```bash
(my-package)$ npm run codeowners
```

Custom configuration can be defined in many places, for more information check [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig)
